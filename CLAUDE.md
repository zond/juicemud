# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working with this repository.

## TODO

- Add doc comments to functions where complexity and naming makes it relevant. Think hard about each comment to make sure it's correct and clear.
- Add tests for functions or flows that are important and difficult to reason about.

## Rules

- CLAUDE.md should only contain AI instructions, not general project documentation.
- README.md should contain project overview, architecture, and usage instructions.
- docs/ should contain detailed documentation for specific subsystems that need extra insight.
- Always update CLAUDE.md, README.md, and docs/ when they become out of date.
