# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working with this repository.

## TODO

- Benchmark JS engines with Go bindings to find the one that fits our usecase the best.
- Add tests for functions or flows that are important and difficult to reason about.

## Rules

- CLAUDE.md should only contain AI instructions, not general project documentation.
- README.md should contain project overview, architecture, and usage instructions.
- docs/ should contain detailed documentation for specific subsystems that need extra insight.
- Always update CLAUDE.md, README.md, and docs/ when they become out of date.
- Always make sure functions have doc comments, if they are too complex for their name to fully describe what they do.
